# TRENDY Configurations

This branch contains the S0 TRENDY configuration, which is described in the [TRENDY Protocols](https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/trendy/protocol/) as

> Control. No forcing change (time-invariant “pre-industrial” CO2, climate and land use mask). S0 is needed to diagnose any “cold start” issues or model drift.

The forcing components are described in detail in the [TRENDY Protocols](https://blogs.exeter.ac.uk/trendy/protocol/).

See the ```stage_config.yaml``` for the staged setup for CABLE.
